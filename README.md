## Errata

This repository consists of the Covidsafe and the 2 different ways of it being decompiled.

These are [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx), [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/) & [apk2goldreloaded](https://github.com/techgaun/apk2gold-reloaded).

**apk2gold-reloaded did have some errors on export. I've attached the logs, haven't had time to go through them.**
**I pressume everything should be alright.**

I guess this is down to speculation but like Singapore's [Opentrace](https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-android) it is written in Kotlin.
